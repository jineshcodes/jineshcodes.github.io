    <p class="intro">Hi! I am Jinesh and I am a programmer.</p>
    <p>I currently work as a SWE III at Google. Before joining Google, I worked at Microsoft for 4 years. </p>

<p>I am passionate about computer science and tech in general. I love to keep learning and to do this I am pursuing <a href= "https://omscs.gatech.edu/">OMSCS offered by Georgia Tech</a>.</p> 

<p>This blog is where I document all my learnings and experiences as I navigate through the world of Computer science and engineering. You should follow this blog if you think you would be interested in reading articles ranging from CS theory and experiments to learnings from my day job.</p>

<p>I recently cracked multiple big tech company interviews. I love to document the process that made me successful in achieving this. You can find interview preparation articles related <a href= "https://jinesh.codes/interview/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Also, I am one of the Creators behind Caption AI. Now, you ask what caption AI is? You can find it on <a href= "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=caption.ai"> play store here </a>. </p>
